# ADR-0001: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) provide a way to document important decisions, their context, and consequences.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as described by Michael Nygard in this article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

## Consequences
- ADRs are stored in `docs/adr/`
- Each ADR is numbered sequentially and monotonically
- ADRs can be marked as "Superseded" by later ADRs
- ADRs follow the format: `NNNN-title.md`
